**Problem Statement :**

The marketplace team has access to the URLs of all the gold coin products being sold on their platform. Recently, they discovered that their competitors are offering gold coins at different prices on their own websites. The team wants to analyze these competitor prices and adjust their own pricing strategy to remain competitive in the market. By lowering their prices or offering better deals, they aim to attract more customers, increase the number of orders, and ultimately improve company profits.
